## React URL Sraper

No more ugly URL's. 

* If the domain doesn't exist, it will just set the domain name
* It accounts for "http", "https", and "www" prefixes
* This will fetch the `<title>` attribute.
* Can be configured to get _any_ attribute you want
* Uses `cheerio`

## Get started

* run `npm start`

* run on port 3001 `PORT=3001 npm start`

* production `npm run build`
